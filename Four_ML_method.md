# Four methods/stuctures for machine learning

In this blog, four methods will be introduced in machine learning area, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Autoencoders nad Long-short term memory (LSTM)

## Independent Conponent Analysis (ICA)

Let's assume that you have a dog and a cat, today is a rainy weekend, and you have nothing to do so you decided to watch a movie at home.

The movie is splendid, you are really enjoying it, however, it seems like your dog and cat is boring too, so they decide to have a fight with each other to have some fun. So in this time, they are shouting to each other and that really impacts you to hear the sound of the movie.

You are annoying, but there's nothing you can do to stop them because they will fight again, so you are trying to ignore them, and pay all your attention to the movie, luckily, that really works!! You can hear the characters talking in the movie! In this case, you think: Let these two small devils fight then, I can ignore their noise and enjoy the movie.
